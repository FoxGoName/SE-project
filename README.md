Picture 2
The game will end if the blood volume is deducted to 0 (picture 3), and you can play again.

Purpose of the software
1.Which type of software development process is applied?
Our game is applied Agile software development process.

2.Why we chose this type?
Because we want to ensure the best efficiency for this software development project, streamline the process and reduce costs (e.g. time). The agile software development process allows us to respond very quickly to changes in requirements. For example, users want the game to have a new style, or to link with a certain brand. At this time, we can modify and add codes in the shortest time to meet these new requirements.What we care about is that requirement changes and user feedback can be dynamically managed and integrated into the software in a timely manner.

3.Possible usage of our software.
Target market:People with fragmented breaks.(Our game doesn't require a lot of time to play, which makes short breaks entertaining for people with more fragmented breaks.)

Development process
Demand stage
Enter the output stage of the visualized product, discuss and provide the simplest and closest to the finished product "Product Prototype".
According to the needs and project requirements, each student clarified the time points of the detailed stages, and finally carried out the "Project Task Decomposition" according to the development plan to complete the division of labor of the project.

Design phase
The students provide the interface annotations, and finally according to the main interface, the students who write the code output the "Requirement Specification" in Unity

Development stage
Students who write code officially enter the coding stage. Although most of the time in this process is spent writing code, functional review will be carried out after coding.

Testing phase
The students who write the code modify the code according to the test results, submit the test after completion, and complete it after passing the test.
